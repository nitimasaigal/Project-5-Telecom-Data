(When we click on BROWSE FILES, then we need to attach input_features which is given here in this repository, and then prediction will be there after clicking the button PREDICT)

1. Project Name: User Analytics in the Telecommunication Industry

2. Description: This project is related to all the features of a Telecom Industry which includes:
   a) User Overview Analysis
   b) User Engagement Analysis
   c) User Experience Analysis
   d) User Satisfaction Analysis

3. Dependencies: The versions and libraries which have been used are: a) numpy b) pandas c) matplotlib d) seaborn e) sklearn

4. Configuration: An excel file was imported for this purpose and after cleaning the data and its preprocessing before using algorithms, a csv file was made and saved and exported for Streamlit Dashboard.

5. Testing: Many statistical methods like dimensionality reduction and visualizations have been used and then splitted the data for training and testing sets. A Regression Model has been created to predict Satisfaction score which means a customer's satisfaction prediction.

6. Deployment: Random Forest Regression method has been used for final model.

7. Gaming and Others are the applications which affect Total data the most followed by Youtube and Netflix.

8. Troubleshooting: Many many errors were there while solving all the data and applying all the functions but all those were solved by searching in google. The data was very large.

9. Code Style: Very very simple coding has been used according to the demand of this data like groupby, valuecounts etc.

10. Roadmap: This is first project in which we used Kmeans clustering and built clusters and labels. Hope to solve many more projects and more algorithms like this.

11. Security: This repository is public and Tableau is also public.

12. Credits: All credits goes to Shweta Mam and our Faculty Arun Sir.
